-------------------------- Sample Run 1 --------------------------
This program compares two applicants to determine which one seems like the stronger applicant. For each candidate I will need either SAT or ACT scores as well as a weighted GPA.
Information for the first applicant:
         do you have 1) SAT scores or 2) ACT scores? 1
SAT math? 450
SAT verbal? 530
overall GPA? 3.4
max GPA? 4.0
Information for the second applicant:
         do you have 1) SAT scores or 2) ACT scores? 2
ACT English? 25
ACT math? 20
ACT reading? 18
ACT science? 15
overall GPA? 3.3
max GPA? 4.0

First applicant overall score = 147.92
Second applicant overall score = 135.83
The first applicant seems to be better.
